<h1>Automatic Detection and Classification of Skin Lesion 
Images Using Deep Learning Techniques</h1>

This repository contains code and dataset for generating a model to detect skin lesions from user-inputted images using various architectures namely Xception, InceptionV3, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet121 ResNet50. The project focuses on multi class image classification, specifically classifying skin lesion images into different categories related to monkeypox. The repository includes the necessary code and steps to train and evaluate the model.
